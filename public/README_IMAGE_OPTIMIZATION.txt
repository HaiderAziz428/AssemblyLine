Car.webp and backGround.webp are optimized (WebP) versions of Car.png and backGround.png, used for the hero section for better performance and LCP.

Unused images in this folder (not referenced in the codebase) should be deleted to reduce deploy size and improve performance.

If you add new hero images, always optimize and use WebP/AVIF formats.
